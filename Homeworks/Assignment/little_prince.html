        <p>As the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took him in</p>
        <p>my arms and set out walking once more. <u>I felt deeply</p>
        <p>moved, and stirred. It seemed to me that I was</p>
        <p>carrying a very fragile treasure</u>. <mark style="background-color: orange">It seemed to me, even,</p>
        <p>that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth.</mark>In the</p>
        <p>moonlight I looked at his pale forehead, his closed</p>
        <p>eyes, his locks of hair that trembled in the wind, and I</p>
        <p>said to myself: <b><span style="color: red">"What I see here is nothing but a</span>
        <p style="color: red;">shell. What is most important is invisible...‚Äù</p></b>
        <p>As his lips open slightly with the suspicion of a</p>
        <p>half-smile, I said to myself, again<b>:<span style="color: red">"What moves me</span></p>
        <p style="color: red">so deeply, about this little prince who is sleeping</p>
        <p style="color: red">here, is his loyalty to a flower--the image of a rose</p>
        <p style="color: red">that shines through his whole being like the flame</p>
        <p style="color: red">of a lamp, even when he is asleep . . . " </p><p></b>And I felt</p>
        <p>him to be more fragile still.<u> I felt the need of</p>
        <p>protecting him, as if he himself were a flame that</p>
        <p>protecting him, as if he himself were a flame that</p>
        <p>might be extinguished by a little puff of wind . . .</u></p>
