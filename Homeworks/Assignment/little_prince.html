        <p>As the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took him in</p>
        <p>my arms and set out walking once more. <span class = "pUnderline">I felt deeply</span></p>
        <p><span class = "pUnderline">moved, and stirred. It seemed to me that I was</span></p>

        <p><mark>that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth.</mark> In the</p>
        <p>moonlight I looked at his pale forehead, his closed</p>
        <p>eyes, his locks of hair that trembled in the wind, and I</p>
        <p>said to myself: <span class="pColor">"What I see here is nothing but a</span>

        <p><span class="pColor">here, is his loyalty to a flower--the image of a rose</span></p>
        <p><span class="pColor">that shines through his whole being like the flame</span></p>
        <p><span class="pColor"> a lamp, even when he is asleep . . . "</span> And I felt </p>
        <p>him to be more fragile still.<span class = "pUnderline"> I felt the need of</span></p>
        <p><span class = "pUnderline">protecting him, as if he himself were a flame that</span></p>
